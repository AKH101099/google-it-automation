Why do we need to learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language?

* To be able to easily switch to a different programming language
* So that we know which part is the subject and which one is the predicate
* **To allow us to clearly express what we want the computer to do**
* To understand why our computer crashes

> Knowing the syntax and understanding the semantics of a programming language allows us to tell the computer what we want it to do.
