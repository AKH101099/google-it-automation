Here's how printing "Hello, World" 10 times looks in Bash and Powershell:

**Bash:**

```
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo Hello, World!
done
```

**Powershell:**

```
for ($i=1; $i -le 10; $i++) { 
  Write-Host "Hello, World!"
}
```

Now try out the Python example yourself:

```
for i in range(10):
  print("Hello, World!")
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
Hello, World!
```
