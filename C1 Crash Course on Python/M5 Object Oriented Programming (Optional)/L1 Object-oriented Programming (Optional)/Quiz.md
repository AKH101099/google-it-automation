Attributes are characteristics associated with a type. Methods are:

* Lists associated with a type
* Instances of a class
* **Functions associated with a type**
* Characteristics associated with a type

> A method defines what you do with an object.

You want to find more information about the integer (int) class. What’s the best way to do this?

* **Use the command help(int)**
* Use the command type(int)
* Type ‘q’
* Use the len() function

> Using the help command can be useful for finding quick documentation about the methods in a class.

## Video: Defining New Classes

Fill in the blanks in the code to make it print a poem.

```
class Flower:
  color = 'unknown'

rose = Flower()
rose.color = 'Red'

violet = Flower()
violet.color = 'Blue'

this_pun_is_for_you = "This pun is for you."

print("Roses are {},".format(rose.color))
print("violets are {},".format(violet.color))
print(this_pun_is_for_you) 
```

Output:

```
Roses are Red,
violets are Blue,
This pun is for you.
```
