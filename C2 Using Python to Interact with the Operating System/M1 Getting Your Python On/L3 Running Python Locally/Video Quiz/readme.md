## Video: Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages

Which of the following programming languages are interpreted languages?

* Java and C#
* **Python and Javascript**
* C++ and Go
* C and Rust

> Interpreted languages trade off slightly slower runtime performance—removing the need for compiling—by using programs called interpreters to execute the code.

## Video: How to Run a Python Script

What is the purpose of using a shebang line in a Python file?

* To tell the operating system where to find programs to execute.
* To tell the operating system to execute a file in the current directory.
* **To specify beforehand what command to use when running the script.**
* To make the specified file executable by changing permissions.

> Inserting a shebang line (such as #!/usr/bin/env python3) as the first line tells the operating system what command we want to use to execute the script.

## Video: Your Own Python Modules

Proper code reuse is important, so let’s see if you were paying attention. Which of the following lines will allow you to use the datetime module in your script?

## Video: What is an IDE?

Which of the following is NOT an example of code completion?

* After you type the letters “ret”, your IDE finishes your sentence with return.
* After typing the opening parentheses after a function, your IDE inputs the final parentheses.
* **After typing “def”, your IDE detects that you are typing a function and highlights it.**
* After typing the first few letters of an existing variable, your IDE suggests that variable, highlighting the suggestion.

> Syntax highlighting detects the language we’re writing our code in and highlights the pieces of code that make up the syntax of the language.
