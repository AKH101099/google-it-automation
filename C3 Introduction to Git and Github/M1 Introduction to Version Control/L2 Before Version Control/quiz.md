## Video: Keeping Historical Copies

What’s the goal of a version control system?

* To make sure that our code has no bugs
* **To keep track of changes made to our files**
* To have backup copies of our code
* To store code, images, configuration, and videos

> A version control system allows us to keep track of when and who did what changes to our files. Those can be code, configuration, images, or whatever else we need to track.

## Video: Diffing Files

What’s the goal of the diff tool?

* To keep track of changes to our files
* To check if our changes make sense
* To highlight new lines in Python files
* **To show the differences between two files**

> The diff tool shows all the differences between any type of file. By highlighting what’s changed, it helps us understand the changes and see how the files have been modified.
