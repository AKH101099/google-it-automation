## Video: What is version control?

What does a version control system do?

* It groups all related code.
* It explains why a change was made.
* **It keeps track of changes we do to our files.**
* It prevents us from changing files by mistake.

> By keeping track of the changes that we make to our files, a VCS lets us know when a file changed, who changed it, and also lets us easily roll back those changes.

Why is a version control system useful, even if it's used only by a single person? Check all that apply.

* **Seeing the history of the changes helps us understand what changed and why.**
* Tracking code in a VCS ensures that it's bug free.
* **Tracking changes allows for easy rollbacks when a problem is detected.**
* Storing files in a VCS avoids the need for any kind of backups.

> One of the main benefits of a VCS is that you can see the history of how files changed and understand what changed at each step and what motivated the change.

> By having each change tracked in the VCS, it's very easy to go back to previous versions when an issue with a change is discovered.

## Video: What is Git?

What characteristics make Git particularly powerful? Check all that apply.

* It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
* **It's a distributed VCS, which means that each developer has a full copy of the repository.**
* It's maintained by a team of distributed developers.
* **Repositories can be used by as many developers as needed.**

> Because each contributor to a Git repo has a full copy of the repository, they can interact with the tracked files without needing a coordinating server. In turn, this improves collaboration.

> Because of the way Git was designed, repositories can be useful for any number of developers, from one to thousands.
