## Best Practice for Collaboration

* Always synchronize your branches before starting any work on your own
* Avoid having very large changes that modify a lot of different things
* When working on a big change, it makes sense to have a separate feature branch
* Regulary merge changes made on the master branch back onto the feature branch
* Have the latest version of the project in the master branch, and the stable version of the project on a separate branch
