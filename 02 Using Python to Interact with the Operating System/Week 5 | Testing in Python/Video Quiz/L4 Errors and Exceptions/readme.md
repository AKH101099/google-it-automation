# Errors and Exceptions

## The Try-Except Construct

When a try block is not able to execute a function, which of the following return examples will an exception block most likely NOT return?

* Empty String
* Zero
* **Error**
* Empty List

> An exception is not meant to produce an error, but to bypass it. 

## Raising Errors

What keyword can help provide a reason an error has occurred in a function?

* return
* **assert**
* raise
* minlen

> This keyword is used to produce a message when a conditional is false.

## Testing for Expected Errors

When using the assertRaises method, what is passed first?

* **Error**
* Function name
* Parameters
* Conditional

> Way to go! The expected error is passed first.
