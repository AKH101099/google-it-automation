# Automating Tasks Through Programming

## Benefits of Automation

In terms of automation, which of the following is an example of scalability?

* You fix an error in a script and it’s fixed there, once and forever.
* **An IT engineer writes a script to compile a report on each machine's uptime and downtime for the day and email it to relevant parties every evening.**
* A company hires more IT staff to keep up with work levels.
* Minimizing workloads to stay within current productivity levels

> Scalability means that when more work is added to a system, the system can do whatever it needs to complete the work.

## Pitfals of Automation

Which of the following correctly describes the Pareto Principle?

* If we estimate that it’d take less time to automate the task than to do it manually, chances are it’s a good candidate for automation.
* **One fifth of the sysadmin tasks you perform comprise four fifths of your total workload.**
* Is the time and effort it takes to write the script worth the potential automation benefits?
* Four fifths of the sysadmin tasks you perform comprise one fifth of your total workload.

> The Pareto Principle states that 20% of the system administration tasks you perform are responsible for 80% of your workload. Therefore, identifying and automating those tasks will put your productivity through the roof!

## Practical Automation Example

Which of the following could be a good example of when to use an automation script?

* Automate a process you might never use again
* Automate a five-minute process that occurs once every six months
* Automate a process that will take longer to implement than it takes to do manually
* **Detect dangerously high CPU usage levels across a network and scale back the CPU clock speeds of those devices, or shut them down to prevent overheating**

> These days most consumer devices do this on their own, but in the case of custom hardware or other specific use cases such as cluster networks, automation would fit this task nicely and reduce failover.
